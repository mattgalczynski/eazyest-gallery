Eazyest Gallery offers a multitude of options for your WordPress blog by featuring a smart back end management site.

== Description ==

Create a photo gallery from your existing photo directories 

This gallery basically needs just two settings: Your image directory and your gallery page. Eazyest Gallery automatically creates a photo gallery with folders, sub folders, thumbnail pages and slide shows.
 
If you want more, the gallery offers a multitude of options by featuring a smart back end management site. You can sort photos through folders and add captions, comments and descriptions with minimal effort. If you are tired of uploading photos through the WordPress server, this plug-in will make it a breeze with their FTP auto-indexing integration.
